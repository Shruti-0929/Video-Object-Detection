# Video-Object-Detection

Object Detection in Video is done with opencv and numpy


For this installation of following dependencies are required:
1.Numpy(numpy)
2.OpenCV(opencv-python)
3.Pillow(pillow)
4.Matplotlib(matplotlib)

### Overview

In this first the video is converted into single frames and then each frame is considered as a 
single image.

Each single image is processed by using different filters like removing background, 
converting rgb to gray, bluring image with gaussianblur.

After processing and detecting object from each frame/image the object is counted and displayed the count.
